<p>There are several simple routines that can help make the preparation
of civil registration data for tabulation less time consuming. This
vignette uses the <a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/" class="external-link">tidyverse</a>
suite of R packages to deal with common problems such as incorrect data
types, duplicate rows, and missing values.</p>
<p>We will use a synthetic dataset that has the appearance of civil
registration data to experiment with. The states of Nigeria are used but
otherwise the data are completely fictional.</p>

<h2 id="characters-as-dates">Characters as dates<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#characters-as-dates"></a>
</h2>
<p>Dates can be inputted in a variety of formats such as “1 August 24”,
Aug 1, 2024”, and “2024-08-01”. Sometimes R will not be able to parse a
date and will read it as a character.</p>
<p>The variable <code>birth1a</code> (Date of occurrence, Event) is a
character but it should be a date. We can coerce it to a date by passing
it to the <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/as.Date.html" class="external-link">as.Date()</a></code> function and choosing the corresponding
date format. <code>birth1a</code> follows the <a href="https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html" class="external-link">ISO
8601</a> standard for dates or ‘YYYY-MM-DD’ so we need to format the
data with “%Y-%m-%d”.</p>
