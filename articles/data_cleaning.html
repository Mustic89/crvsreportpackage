<p>There are several simple routines that can help make the preparation
of civil registration data for tabulation less time consuming. This
vignette uses the <a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/" class="external-link">tidyverse</a>
suite of R packages to deal with common problems such as incorrect data
types, duplicate rows, and missing values.</p>
<p>We will use a synthetic dataset that has the appearance of civil
registration data to experiment with. The states of Nigeria are used but
otherwise the data are completely fictional.</p>

<p>There are 9 variables in our data:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>id</code></li>
<li>
<code>birth1a</code> (Date of occurrence, Event)</li>
<li>
<code>birth1b</code> (Date of registration, Event)</li>
<li>

<li>
<code>birth2a</code> (Sex, Newborn)</li>
<li>
<code>birth3b</code> (Age, Mother)</li>
</ul>
<p>The variable <code>birth1b</code> is of type date,
<code>birth3b</code> integer, and the others are all character.</p>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="characters-as-dates">Characters as dates<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#characters-as-dates"></a>
</h2>
<p>Dates can be inputted in a variety of formats such as “1 August 24”,
Aug 1, 2024”, and “2024-08-01”. Sometimes R will not be able to parse a
date and will read it as a character.</p>
<p>The variable <code>birth1a</code> is a character but it should be a
date. We can coerce it to a date by passing it to the
<code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/as.Date.html" class="external-link">as.Date()</a></code> function and choosing the corresponding date
format. <code>birth1a</code> follows the <a href="https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html" class="external-link">ISO
8601</a> standard for dates or ‘YYYY-MM-DD’ so we need to format the
data with “%Y-%m-%d”.</p>

<p>There may be inputting errors in the civil registration data such as
the date of occurrence being recorded <em>after</em> the date of

a simple filter. The code below selects all of the rows where the date

<p>It is common practice to read known values of a variable as
characters, hence <code>stringsAsFactors = FALSE</code>. However, once
